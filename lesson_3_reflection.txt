When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

... for collaboration with others working on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

... to avoid breaking features you are working on and having errors from others 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

...fork is a copy of github project with attribution to the original, clone is a copy of git or github project
with no attribution, branch is a new position
